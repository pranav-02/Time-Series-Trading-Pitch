# Time-Series-Trading-Pitch

Attached is a short description of the project, for a more in depth explanation please visit the PDF link:

Forecasting volatility is often the biggest discrepancy between different market agents in options pricing. Differences in forecasted volatility can result in dramatically different price estimates, which is the focus of this pitch. Using two different time series models, we will construct price intervals for options contracts, and based off of discrepancies with the forecasted price interval and current option prices we will trade to find out if:
  
  a) The two time series modeling methods create returns that are statistically significant from null hypothesis of zero
  
  b) If one of the methods produces substantially different results than the other, and the reason for the difference
